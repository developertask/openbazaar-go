This repository contains the developertask server daemon which handles the heavy lifting for the [developertask](https://openbazaar.org/) desktop application. The server combines several technologies: A modified [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) node, which itself combines ideas from Git, BitTorrent, and Kademlia. A lightweight wallet for interacting with several cryptocurrency networks. And a JSON API which can be used by a user interface to control the node and browse the network. Find the user interface for the server at [github.com/developertask/openbazaar-desktop](https://github.com/developertask/openbazaar-desktop).

## Install

A typical install of developertask contains a bundle of the server daemon and user interface. If this is what you are looking for, you can find an installer at https://openbazaar.org/download. If you are looking to run the server daemon by itself or to contribute to development, see below for instructions.

### Install Pre-built Packages

The easiest way to run the server is to download a pre-built binary. You can find binaries of our latest release for each operating system [here](https://github.com/developertask/openbazaar-go/releases/).

### Build from Source

To build from source you will need to have Go installed and properly configured. Detailed instructions for installing Go and openbazaar-go on each operating system can be found in the [docs package](https://github.com/developertask/openbazaar-go/tree/master/docs).

## Dependency Management

We use [Godeps](https://github.com/tools/godep) with vendored third-party packages.

### IPFS Dependency

We are using a [fork](https://github.com/developertask/go-ipfs) of go-ipfs in the daemon. The primary changes include different protocol strings to segregate the developertask network from the main IPFS network and an increased TTL on certain types of DHT data. You can find the full diff in the readme of the forked repo. The fork is bundled in the vendor package and will be used automatically when you compile and run the server. Note that you will still see github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs import statements instead of github.com/developertask/go-ipfs despite the package being a fork. This is done to avoid a major refactor of import statements and make rebasing IPFS much easier.

## Updating

You can either pull in remote changes as normal or run `go get -u github.com/developertask/openbazaar-go`.

## Usage

You can run the server with `go run openbazaard.go start`. Ensure you are using at least version `1.10` of Golang, otherwise you might get errors while running.

### Options

## Documentation

Documentation of the developertask protocol has not been formalized yet. If you would like to help, please reach out on [Slack](https://openbazaar.org/slack/) or via a new issue on GitHub.

`openbazaar-go` exposes an HTTP API which permits high-level interactions on the network and the internal wallet. Find the HTTP API documentation at [https://api.docs.openbazaar.org](https://api.docs.openbazaar.org).
